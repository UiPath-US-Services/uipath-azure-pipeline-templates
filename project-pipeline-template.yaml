# Staged pipeline with an approval process for production releases.
#
# Approvals are not defined here, but rather tied to the environment. 
#
# As is, this pipeline template will deploy to the Test environment on commits to any release* branch without approvals,
# and will deploy to the Prod environment on commits to the master branch, after approval.

parameters:
# The full path to the folder containing the project.json file for this pipeline
- name: 'projectPath'
  default: '.'
  type: string
# The name of the folder to deploy the package to.
- name: 'folderName'
  default: 'Default'
  type: string
# Either AutoVersion to generate a build number or CurrentVersion to match the project.json version.
- name: 'versioningStrategy'
  default: 'CurrentVersion'
  type: string
# The environments to update the package version to the deployed version. 
# Not required for modern folders or if you do not want to update the package version.

  default: ''
